# 🏆 Achievement System Documentation

## Overview
The Achievement System is a gamification feature that rewards users for reaching financial milestones, maintaining good habits, and engaging with the budget app. It uses an event-driven architecture to track user activities and automatically unlock achievements.

## 🎯 How It Works

### Architecture
```
DataContext → Custom Events → AchievementsContext → UI Updates
```

1. **DataContext** dispatches custom events when trackable actions occur
2. **AchievementsContext** listens for these events and processes achievement logic
3. **UI Components** display achievements and progress to the user

### Event-Driven Communication
To avoid circular dependencies, the system uses DOM custom events:

```javascript
// DataContext dispatches events
document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('savingsActivity', { 
  detail: { amount: transaction.amount } 
}));

// AchievementsContext listens for events
document.addEventListener('savingsActivity', handleSavingsActivity);
```
